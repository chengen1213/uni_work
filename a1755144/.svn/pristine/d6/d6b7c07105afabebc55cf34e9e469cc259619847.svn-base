Auto testing:
1. rm *.class
2. javac *.java
3. java Test
This will prepare the environment for the project and execute all the test cases designed in the Test class.

Manually testing:

java AggregationServer [port number] (default 4567)

java ContentServer [number of content servers] [option] (m for manually setting the IP and port number)
The local file should named as content + sequence number + .xml
For example, if you create 2 content server (using the second parameter), you should have content1.xml and content2.xml locally

java GETClient [output file name] (default as default.txt) [option] (same as above)
